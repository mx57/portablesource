# PortableSource

Easy install ANY AI by few clicks.
A brief installation guide:
You can use either the portable or standalone version, it's up to you. But when you install PortableSource on your computer, PLEASE! Read these 3 simple points, which will save you a headache and me from useless issues:
1. Never put IT in Downloads. 
2. It is CRITICALLY IMPORTANT to use the root of the disk! For example, a folder like:
C:\Portablesource or C:\PS. DO NOT INSTALL ON THE DISK ITSELF! ALWAYS install in a folder!
3. NO SYMBOLS OTHER THAN ENGLISH IN THE PATHS! No spaces, no special symbols, no symbols from languages other than English.

I hope this memo will help you save time and nerves!
