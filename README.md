## Tired of slow, bloated, and insecure AI tools? So was I.

Tools like Pinokio are popular, but they come with a price: messy architectures, questionable security practices, and a complete lack of accountability from anonymous developers. **This is unacceptable.**

I wrote a [full investigation into Pinokio's security risks](https://blog.neurodonu.dev/how-is-it-pinokio/) that revealed these issues. Then I built the solution.

**PortableSource is everything Pinokio isn't:**
*   **Fast & Lightweight:** Built on Rust for maximum performance and minimal footprint. No more gigabytes of junk from Conda.
*   **Truly Portable:** Designed from the ground up to run anywhere, solving critical path length issues on Windows with virtual disks.
*   **Secure & Transparent:** Built with a clean, modern architecture and a developer who takes responsibility. No monkey-patching, no shady practices.

This is the new standard.

## Quick Start & **IMPORTANT Rules**

You can grab the latest release [here](https://github.com/portablesource/portablesource/releases/latest). To avoid headaches, please follow these 3 critical rules:

1.  **DO NOT use your `Downloads` folder.**
2.  **INSTALL IN A FOLDER AT THE ROOT OF A DRIVE.** For example: `C:\PortableSource` or `D:\PS`. Never install directly onto the drive itself (`C:\`).
3.  **ENGLISH CHARACTERS ONLY** in the installation path. No spaces, no special symbols.
